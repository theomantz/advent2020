The first day of the advent of code challenge presented the narrative of the challenge, giving us a holiday themed backstory. Essentially, two points will be issued each day, one point for each part of the daily challenge. Fifty points are required to finish the story.

The day 1 challenge presented a data set of sets of integers, each on its own new line. The goal was to find the two sets of integers which added to 2020 and then return the product of the two integers. 

The difficulty in this challenge lies in the extraction of the data from its current form into something more readily indexable by Python. Once that was acheived, the remaining portion was fairly rudimentary.
